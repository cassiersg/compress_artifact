# COMPRESS artifact

This repository contains the artifact for the paper [**Compress: Reducing Area
and Latency of Masked Pipelined Circuits**](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1600).
The artifact contains all the code on which the results presented in the paper
are based, except for COMPRESS itself, which is in a [separate
repository](https://github.com/cassiersg/compress) (and is included as a
submodule of this repository).

## Getting started

When getting this artifact from github, clone the repository with the
[submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules):
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/cassiersg/compress_artifact
```

The scripts in the repository assume a unix environment (bash, GNU make, coreutils, etc.), as well as the following dependencies:

- python3 (python3.10 tested) with venv (`python3-venv` on Ubuntu)
- yosys (version 0.33 tested)
- iverilog (version 11.0 tested)

Some part of the artifact additionally require:

- [AGEMA](https://github.com/Chair-for-Security-Engineering/AGEMA) (commit `4e43d9d61` tested)
- [fullverif](https://github.com/cassiersg/fullverif) (commit `227f31215` tested)
- [SILVER](https://github.com/Chair-for-Security-Engineering/SILVER) (commit `57fd89b71` tested, some more recent versions do not work)
- [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) (version 4.1.0 tested)

## Using COMPRESS directly

See `compress/README.md` or <https://github.com/cassiersg/compress>.

## Reproducing results of the paper

All components of the artifact can be run through the top-level `Makefile`.

### Required environment variables

- `yosys` and `iverilog` must be in `PATH`.
- For AGEMA targets: `AGEMA_ROOT` must point to the root AGEMA directory (the one that contains `bin/` and `cell/`).
- For AES design verification: `FULLVERIF` must point to the `fullverif` binary (typically ending in `fullverif-check/target/release/fullverif`), or `fullverif` must be in `PATH`.
- For gadget verification with SILVER: `SILVER_ROOT` must point to the root SILVER directory (the one that contains `bin/` and `cell/`).

### Optionnal environment variables

Some of the `Makefile` targets developped after may take a significant time to complete. Typically, the time required to simulate the execution of a circuit can be of the order of an hour for behavioural simulation, or several hours for structural simulations. Besides, the execution time of COMPRESS is rather fast for small circuit, but increase with the size of the circuit due to the usage of a SAT solver. Based on that, the following environment variables enable some level of control on the flow by skipping the most time consuming steps:

- `SKIP_BEH_SIMU` (default: 0): set to 1 in order to skip behavioral simulations.
- `SKIP_STRUCT_SIMU` (default: 1): set to 1 in order to skip structural simulations.
- `TIMEOUT_COMPRESS` (default: 3600): timeout (in seconds) for the COMPRESS' SAT solver execution time. CAUTION: reducing the timeout value may affect the performances of the generated circuits (e.g., some adders circuits reached the 1h timeout, as mentioned in Table 7 of the paper). 

You can set these variables by editing the Makefile, or directly in the make command as follows:

```
SKIP_STRUCT_SIMU=1 make $TARGET
```

### S-boxes 

The following `make` targets generate masked AES and 8-bit Skinny S-box designs
using various automated tools.
These also synthesize the designs and report area, using yosys and
the NanGate45 library.

- COMPRESS (new):

    ```
    make aes_sbox_compress # Boyar-Peralta AES S-box
    make canright_aes_sbox_opt # Canright AES S-box
    make skinny_sbox_compress
    ```

- Optimized HPC2 implementations with the tool of the
[''handcrafting''](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/252) paper:

    ```
    make sbox_handcrafting
    ```

- Pipeline HPC3 implementation using
[AGEMA](https://github.com/Chair-for-Security-Engineering/AGEMA).

    ```
    make sbox_agema # Requires $AGEMA_ROOT to be set
    ```

The reports for area usage and design generation execution time are in 
`work/{aes,skinny}_{opt,sep,base}/{aes_bp,skinny8}_area.csv` for COMPRESS,
`work/handcrafting/{aes_bp,skinny8}_area.csv` for handcrafting, and
`work/agema_{skinny,aes}/{aes_bp,skinny8}_areas.csv` for AGEMA.


We also synthesize existing masked S-box designs with yosys and Nangate45:


- Serialized Skinny8 S-box of [VCS22] (area report: `work/skinny_serialized/areas.csv`):

    ```
    make skinny_sbox_serialized
    ```

- DOM-indep AES S-box [GMK16] (area report: `work/DOM_aes_sbox/d{2,3,4,5}/area/area.json`):

    ```
    make dom_aes_sbox
    ```

- AES Sbox from [DSM22] (area report: `work/low_random_second_order_aes/area/area.json`):

    ```
    make lr_2OM_aes_sbox
    ```

- Skinny Sbox from [CCGB21] (area report: `work/skinny_ti/skinny-hdl-thresh-{222,2222,232,33}/area.json`):

    ```
    make skinny_ti
    ```

### Adders

Generation of masked adder circuits and their synthesis is very similar to the
S-boxes, with the following commands:

```
make adders_compress adders_handcrafting adders_agema
```

Area reports are generated respectively in `work/adders/*.csv`,
`work/adders_handcrafting/*.csv` and `work/adders_agema/*.csv`.

### COMPRESS gadget verification

COMPRESS comes with some new gadgets. In addition to the security proofs in the
paper, these gadgets can be verified at the first- and second-order using
[SILVER](https://github.com/chair-for-Security-Engineering/silver):

```
make silver
```

The first-order verification takes a few minutes, the second-order
verification of the larger gadgets ca take multiple hours.

If the first-order verification stalls, check that you are using the supported
SILVER version (see above).

### Full AES designs

For the 32-bit datapath:

- `make aes32beh` performs a behavioral simulation
- `make aes32synth` runs a synthesis (yosys+NanGate45), and compares with [SMAesH](https://github.com/SIMPLE-Crypto/SMAesH).
- `make aes32postsynth` verifies the synthesized circuit with a simulation
- `make aes32fullverif` runs [fullverif](https://github.com/cassiersg/fullverif) to verify the security of the implementation

The synthesis results summary is then located in `work/aes32synth/areas.csv`. The file contains entries for the following designs:

- `new`: AES (SMAesH based) with 4-cycles COMPRESS Sbox (Boyard Peralta repr.) 
- `newcanright`: AES (SMAesH based) with 4-cycles COMPRESS Sbox (Canright repr.)
- `smaesh`: SMAesH design using Sbox from [MCS22]. 

For the 128-bit datapath (round-based):

- `make aes128beh` performs a behavioral simulation
- `make aes128synth` runs a synthesis (yosys+NanGate45), and compares with the [related work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/252).
- `make aes128postsynth` verifies the synthesized circuit with a simulation
- `make aes128fullverif` runs [fullverif](https://github.com/cassiersg/fullverif) to verify the security of the implementation

The synthesis results summary is then located in `work/aes128synth/areas.csv`. The file contains entries for the following designs:

- `aeshpc`: AES with 6-cycles Sbox from [MCS22] 
- `new`: AES with 4-cycles COMPRESS Sbox (Boyard Peralta repr.)
- `newcanright`: AES with 4-cycles COMPRESS Sbox (Canright repr.)
- `new_1round`: 1 round AES pipeline (Boyard Peralta repr., does not include PRNG and state register/control MUXES).

For the (128-bit datapath) AES of AGEMA:

```
make aes128agema
```

For a round-based implementation (fully) generated with compress (Boyard Peralta repr.):

```
make aes_round_compress
```

The synthesis results summary is located in `work/aes_round_compress/aes_round_compress_area.csv`. In the paper, these results are compared with the "handmade" implementation of the round based implementation (i.e., the results reported for `new_1round` above).
